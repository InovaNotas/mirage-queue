# Mirage Queue

This library was intended to help us have the benefits of a message broker without having another infrastructure dependency, meaning it was designed to use a database as a message broker.

###  Currently this library only supports PostgreSQL database 

You can download the package via Nuget using the command below or the Nuget interface in the IDE.

``` shell
dotnet add package MirageQueue.Postgres
```

The initial is pretty simple as you can see:
``` csharp
using MirageQueue;
using MirageQueue.Postgres;
using MirageQueue.Publishers.Abstractions;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);


//Configure the default options for MirageQueue
builder.Services.AddMirageQueue();

//Configure Mirage Queue to use the postgres database 
builder.Services.AddMirageQueuePostgres(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"));

//Register all consumers in the given assembly
builder.Services.AddConsumersFromAssembly(typeof(TestMessageConsumer).Assembly);


var app = builder.Build();

// Create the database and all tables needed to run the Mirage Queue
app.UseMirageQueue();

app.Run();
```

Instead of registering all consumers from a specific assembly you can off course register one by one like this:

``` csharp
builder.Services.AddConsumer<TestMessageConsumer>();
```

To create a consumer you need to implement the interface **IConsumer** with the type parameter of the expected message that you want to receive, and you can have multiple consumers receiving the same message type.

``` csharp
using MirageQueue.Consumers.Abstractions;
using System.Text.Json;

namespace ExampleApi;

public class TestMessageConsumer : IConsumer<TestMessage>
{
    private readonly Random _random = new Random();
    public async Task Process(TestMessage message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Test message {DateTime.Now:hh:mm:ss} {JsonSerializer.Serialize(message)}");
        await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMicroseconds(_random.Next(40, 100)));
    }
}
```

This library provides two ways to deliver messages to the consumer. The first option lets the consumer receive and process the message immediately after itâ€™s sent. The second option allows you to schedule the message for processing at a later time. You can use the **IPublisher** interface via dependency injection.

``` csharp
public class MyService(IPublisher publisher){
    public async Task PublishMessage(){
        await publisher.Publish(new TestMessage
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid()
        });
    }

    public async Task ScheduleMessage(){
        await publisher.Publish(new TestMessage
        {
            Id = Guid.NewGuid()
        },
        DateTime.UtcNow.AddSeconds(3));
    }
}
```
